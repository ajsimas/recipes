## Ingredients

### Cake

- 1 package (18 oz.) yellow cake mix
- 4 large eggs
- 0.75 cup water
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 package (3 oz.) lemon flavored gelatin mix
- 0.75 cup vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp lemon extract

### Glaze

- 0.75 cup powdered sugar
- Fresh lemon juice (amount as needed)

## Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Prepare your cake pan by
   greasing it and dusting it with flour to prevent sticking.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the yellow cake mix, eggs, water, vanilla
   extract, lemon gelatin mix, oil, and lemon extract. Beat the mixture
   according to the package instructions for the cake mix.
3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for approximately 30 minutes,
   or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake
   comes out clean.
4. While the cake is baking, prepare the glaze by mixing the powdered sugar with
   enough lemon juice to achieve a pourable consistency.
5. Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
   Then, pour the glaze over the cake.
6. Return the glazed cake to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes to
   set the glaze.
