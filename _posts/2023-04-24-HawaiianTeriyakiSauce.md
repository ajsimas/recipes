## Ingredients

- 0.5 cups soy sauce
- 0.5 cups brown sugar, packed
- 0.5 cups pineapple juice
- 0.25 cups honey
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp minced ginger
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp water

## Steps

1. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, pineapple juice,
   honey, rice vinegar, minced garlic, minced ginger, black pepper, and red
   pepper flakes (if using).
2. Stir the mixture over medium heat until the brown sugar dissolves completely.
3. In a separate small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry.
4. Slowly whisk the cornstarch slurry into the saucepan, ensuring that the sauce
   is well combined.
5. Continue cooking the sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently until it
   thickens to your desired consistency. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
6. Remove the sauce from heat and allow it to cool slightly before using it as a
   marinade or drizzling it over your favorite dishes.
