- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and black pepper to taste

## Steps

1. In a small bowl, mix together the **mayonnaise**, **Dijon mustard**,
   **honey**, **lemon juice or apple cider vinegar**, and **paprika** until well
   combined.
2. Taste the sauce and add **salt** and **black pepper** to taste. Adjust any of
   the ingredients to your liking.

## Notes

  could be used for a spicier sauce.
- Lemon juice provides a bright acidity, while apple cider vinegar gives a
  milder tang.

- Adjusting the level of honey can make the sauce sweeter or less sweet
  according to preference.
