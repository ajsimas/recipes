## Draft notes
* 8 large egg yolks may be too many?
* Too little crushed candy canes?
* Is sieve necessary?
* Is pre-chilling necessary?
* Is food coloring necessary?
* Butter fat content in heavy cream is 36% and 3.5% in whole milk. Ratio should be 50/50 to acheive butter fat of 19.75% (Which is in the recommended 12%-20%).
